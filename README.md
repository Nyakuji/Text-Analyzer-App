# **Text-Analyzer-App**
Welcome to the Text Analyzer App! This application allows users to analyze text, including `word count`, `character count`, `sentiment analysis`, and `typing speed calculation`. It's a handy tool for improving typing skills, understanding the sentiment of a piece of text, and analyzing word frequency

## **Features**

- **Text Analysis**: Analyze the input text to determine `word count`, `character count`, `sentiment score`, `sentiment result`, and `word frequency`

- **Typing Speed Calculation**: Calculate typing speed in characters per minute while typing.

- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Calculates the frequency of each word in the input text and displays it in a `chart`.

- **Clear Text**: Clear the input text and reset all analysis results.

- **Prevent Pasting**: Prevent copying and pasting of text to ensure accurate typing speed calculation.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Technologies Used**
- **React**: Built using React framework for the frontend user interface.

- **Chakra UI**: Used Chakra UI for styling and components.

- **Sentiment Library**: Utilized the sentiment library for sentiment analysis.

- **Chart.js**: Integrated Chart.js for displaying word frequency in a chart.

- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for React projects.

- **Firebase**: Platform for building web and mobile applications, including Firestore for database storage and Firebase Hosting for deployment.
